## Application routes

### Login

```
POST /v1/login
```

Expects a JSON-formatted body containing `email` and `password` fields. 

Will respond with a payload containing an authentication token to be attached to future requests, as well as up-to-date information about the freshly logged-in user's settings.

```json
{
  "token": "abcd",
  "localisation": {
    ...
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "abcd",
    "displayName": "Joe Docs",
    "email": "joe@tamanu.io",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```
