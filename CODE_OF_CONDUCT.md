# BES Open Source Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within BES-managed communities, as 
well as steps to reporting unacceptable behaviour. Our goal is to make explicit what we 
expect from participants in this community as well as its leaders.

## Our Pledge

As participants in BES-managed communities, we pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, docs site edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applied within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is
officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our communities
include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct within BES-managed communities should 
be reported to the project team by contacting [opensource@bes.au](opensource@bes.au). All complaints will be reviewed 
and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the 
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the 
reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Contributors of BES-managed communities who do not follow the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent 
repercussions determined by the project managers under BES.

This contact method may also be used to raise issues with the Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Warning

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Temporary or Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A ban from any sort of interaction or public communication 
with the community, either permanently or for a specified period of time.
