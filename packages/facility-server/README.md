# Tamanu Facility server

This is the main server that the Tamanu web app communicates with. It stores data in a local
filesystem which syncs to a remote central server.

Setup and configuration instructions can be found in the [main README file](../../README.md).

## Running

Start the server with `yarn run start-dev`.
