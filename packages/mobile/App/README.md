# App Folder

The idea is to separate concerns the best as possible although Domain Driven Design might be more suitable for backend development due to business logic.


|   |   |
|---|---|
| data  | Data Layer is responsible for implementing a Domain Use case and all data mutation and proper validation. |
| domain  | Create use case interfaces to be implemented for Data Layer. Model interfaces for Data Tranfer Objects. |
| factories  | Factories for each use cases.   |
| infra  | Infra Layer is responsible for creating abstractions over modules that the app will use so it becomes easier to replace one lib for another one.  |
| presentations  | Presentation Layer is responsible for creating controllers which will call data layer implementations and returns to the UI the resource, an error or an success result. |
